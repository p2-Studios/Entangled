  body: 'Dear Journal,

    I need to tell someone this but I''m not sure who to
    trust anymore.

    I''m scared. I don''t know exactly what''s been happening
    but something''s gone sideways, I just know it. We used to be able to access
    the whole facility, but now everything below level 7 is locked down. I checked
    the other day and my keycard doesn''t work. People keep going missing and I don''t
    know if they''ve been fired, or they''ve quit, or ... something else. Every time
    I walk into the staff room, there''s a different group of people whispering who
    go quiet as soon as I walk past. I know I''m a fairly new addition to the team,
    but I swear people used to be friendlier. I''m just a materials engineer, not
    an exec or a neurologist or an Entangled suit mechanic, so I don''t know what''s
    been happening with the testing, but I have a really bad feeling about it ...'
