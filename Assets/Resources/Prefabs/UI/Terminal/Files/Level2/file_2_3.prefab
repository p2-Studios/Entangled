  body: "E1: personally, I am very offended that they went with the name Entangled
    for the suits. IT DOESN\u2019T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACTUAL QUANTUM PHYSICS.\r\nE2:
    You know that doesn\u2019t matter to marketing. It\u2019s just a nice, short,
    catchy description. Think of it as just \u2026 an evocative metaphor. \r\nAt
    least one person who hears about it will search it up on a wiki and learn about
    actual quantum entanglement, if that makes you feel better.\r\nE1: and then fail
    to understand its complexities. I\u2019m going to be mad about this FOREVER."
