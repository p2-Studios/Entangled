  body: "But then we -- I, to be precise -- succumbed to human hubris. The success
    of our project and my (potentially excessive) enthusiasm about its applications
    led to companies and investors knocking at our door.\n\nI welcomed them in and
    made them grand promises. They gave me money in exchange, with which I could
    further my research program.\n\nAnd so when things began to go wrong, I spiraled
    down along with them.\n\nThere were whispers of potential psychological side-effects,
    but surely they couldn't be that bad. \"Try again,\" I told the scientists. \"Don't
    cause premature alarm.\"\n\n I took down the the commumications network because
    people were spending too much time on it and I needed them to focus. I quietly
    sent home employees that were intent on stirring up a fuss. I did all this because
    I believed in the project and I had already invested too much time and money.
    The sunk-cost fallacy at its finest. \n\nAnd then, of course, disaster. "
