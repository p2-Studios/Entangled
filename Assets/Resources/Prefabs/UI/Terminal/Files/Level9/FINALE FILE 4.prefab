  body: "Somebody wearing the suit went rogue and began causing havoc. \n\n\rSome
    of my brave employees have managed to contain the threat in the stasis pods on
    the top floor, sacrificing themselves in the process. \r\n\nAnd who was this
    threat? One of our frequent test subjects. A volunteer who threw themselves into
    danger without fully knowing the consequences. I don't even know which one, or
    what their name was -- the circumstances were so chaotic. \n\nFrom the outside,
    all you can see is the suit.\n\nPlease share this message with the world, if
    you can. Be aware of what happened here so that it might never happen again.\n\nSincerely,\nThe
    head of [REDACTED] Industries\n"
