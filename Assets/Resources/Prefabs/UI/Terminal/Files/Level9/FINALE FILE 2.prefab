  body: "And so I expanded the project. My superiors back on Earth were enthusiastic
    about my pitch and encouraged me to take it even further beyond what I had initially
    planned. Construction began on a state-of-the-art, self-sustaining research facility.
    I recruited leading scientists and engineers, neurologists and programmers --
    experts in all the fields that would be needed to help my project vision come
    to life.\n\n Finally the facility was finished and work began. At the start,
    everything was going great. Sure, there were the usual ups and downs of the development
    process, but those were easily overcome. My team was innovative and efficient.
    We'd soon built a working prototype and it functioned better than my wildest
    dreams."
