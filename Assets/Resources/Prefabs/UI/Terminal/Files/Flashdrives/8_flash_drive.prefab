  body: 'I know the head of the facility isn''t doing anything about this, but I''ve
    heard enough reports of the suits causing side effects like aggression that I
    think we need to have a back-up plan. Beginning now, we need to create a stasis
    pod that is able to subdue someone in an Entangled Suit. If this plan ever needs
    to be put into effect, I''ll need some brave volunteers who are willing to risk
    their lives. '
